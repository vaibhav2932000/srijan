## Code Style

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define types explicitly
- Avoid `any` type
- Use interfaces for objects
- Use type for unions/intersections

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Use meaningful component names
- Keep components focused and small
- Extract reusable logic to custom hooks
- Use proper prop types

Good:
```typescript
interface ProductCardProps {
  product: Product;
  compact?: boolean;
}

export default function ProductCard({ product, compact = false }: ProductCardProps) {
  // Component logic
}
```

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Follow mobile-first approach
- Use custom classes from `globals.css` when appropriate
- Keep consistency with design system

Good:
```tsx
<button className="btn-primary">
  Add to Cart
</button>
```

Bad:
```tsx
<button className="px-6 py-3 bg-saffron text-white rounded-lg hover:bg-saffron-dark">
  Add to Cart
</button>
```

### File Organization

- One component per file
- Co-locate related files
- Use index files for cleaner imports
- Keep file names in kebab-case for components
- Keep utility files in camelCase

## Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Update tests when modifying existing code
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Aim for meaningful test coverage

```bash
npm run test
```

## Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Update type definitions
- Include examples in documentation

## Review Process

1. **Automated checks** must pass:
   - TypeScript compilation
   - Linting
   - Tests (if applicable)
   - Build

2. **Code review** by maintainers:
   - Code quality
   - Adherence to guidelines
   - Architecture decisions
   - Performance considerations

3. **Testing** in various scenarios

4. **Merge** once approved
